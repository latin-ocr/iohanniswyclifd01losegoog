be predestinate, and should by dceds ol churity herc on earth deserte
God’s grace, do good works, arrd willingly bear all tribulation. ll we
are more concerned about worldly possessious thau about the kingdom
of Heaven, it is a prdol that we receive this heavenly bread unworthily.
At the present time saith, hope, and charity are turned upside down,
so to speak: our saith is in outward signs, our hope is in the world,
and our charity helps those that least deserre it. The true dispositione
lor the worthy reception of the Sacrament consist in the pure and
grateful love of Christ, and the contempt of worldly goods.¹ Yet who
amongst us, ldo not say, after, hut during Mass, does not serve
the world rather than the Creator ol the world? Our inclinations,
occupatione and actions demonstrate this but too surely: lor we
betray the truth for the salte ol bodily comfort3 but if we do, we
receive Christ’s Body unworthily. lt were well lor the Chureh il it
had lewer idle members and wealthy priests who, led astray by false
appearances, denounce the truth. And even if every celebrating priest
were removed from amongst us, we could still worthily celebrate the
body and blood of Christ, which are in Heaueo.²

But it is objecred (Wyclil here again returns to the decident-
theory) that not only tradition and the words ol the Ritual prove
that the accidents alone remulo, but also the canon Cum Marthae
and other decrees ol the Chureh are in the same sense.

Legends are olten enough corrections ol apocryphal wrirings,
and not unlrequently ol lies, as may be seen lrom a passage in
St. Augustine.³ Eueu the Decretal is not always to be believed; it is
not aCatholic rule of laith, and the Chureh should not be·burdened
by novelties, unknown to Holy Writ. Some laws cannot be changed
eren by God ltimselt, lor such change would inrply sels-contradiction.
Length‚ width and depth cannot exist without material substance; the
earne may be said ol all uccideuts.
