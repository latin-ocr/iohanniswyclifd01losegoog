2. caumata altha traalisa “Ila Eucharistiae

1 n considering the Sacrament of the Altar, we nrust particularly note
three points. first, the Sacrament or outward symbol in itself,¹ i. e. the
consecrated Host. Second, the Sacrament taken together with its object,
viz, the true body and blood of Christ. ilrird, the object of the Sacra-
ment, which however is not the Sacrament: the union of Christ with
His mystic body, the Church. A knowledge of these preliminary notions
is, according to Wyclif (ch. Ι) absolutely indispensable. lt is only
when we properly understand this synthesis that we can appreciate
at its right valae the ‘Accidenttheory’ of some who say that a hog,
a dog or a meuse, can eat our Lord‚ because they can eat the body
of Christ, and consequentiy (ὶοά.2

To such we may reply that what these animals eat is the con-
secrated Hosr, which is but the sacrament, not Christ’s body or His
blood. When a lion devours a man, it does not also devour his soul;
yet his soul is present in every part of his body. lt is thus also with
the Sacrament of the Altar3³ it is quite as really present, in a sacra·
mental, spiritual or virtual manner (sacramentaliter, spiritualiter vel
virtualiter), in every part of the consecrated llost, as the soul is
present in the body.

Secondly, we deny the assertion of those who say that we priests
ean break the body of our Lord‚ His head, throat, arms, and other
nrembers2⁴ to treat llinr thus would be the most atrocious sacrilege.

We affirm, according to the ancient belief of the Church, that
such a conception is utterly false. We indeed break the mere Sacra·'
ment - the consecrated Host: - but we no more break Christ’s
body than we break a sunbeam in a glass or crystal vessel that is
broken.⁵ Such is the meaning of the lines of St. Thomas Aquinas

¹Sce below, p. rr. ²1'lrguunt enim quod sus, canis vel nius potest
comedere Deum nostrum quia corpus Christi quod est Deus. ³ Falsum assumunt,
cum tales bestie possunt comedere hostiam consecratam que cst nudum sacramentum,
ct non corpus Christi vel sanguis. immo sicut leo comedens corpus hominis non
comedit eius animam, licet sit ad omnem punctum illius eorporis, sic intelligendum
est ile corpore Christi in sacramento altaris. ⁸ Secundo obiciunt quod nos sacer·
diates frangimus corpus Christi et per idem caput, collum, erc. ³ Sed nos respon·
demus qunal falsum assumunt, cum frangimus· sacramentum non autem corpus
Christi, sicut uon frangimus rudium solis, licet frangamus vitrum vel lapidum cristallinum.
