land, inaour country. “l mysell‚” said Wyclil‚ “l'earing to be subjected
to persecution, have declared that l humhly wished to becumen
disciple, aad be taught in this matter by such bisbops as were able
to point out the truth to me. But what l want is a signoby which
lmay know that their teaching is true.¹ One ol them teaches in
England that the Host is weight (ponderositas). Wyclil expresses a
wish lor that personage, couched in somewhat grim terms.² The
greater part oi the English Church is lavourable to this doctrine
which prevails in nearly the whole province ol Canterbury.³ Others
say that the Sacrament is quantity; a doctrine no less false than the
other. This opinion counts most partisans in the diocese ol Lincoln.⁴
Others, mostly in the mountain districts ol Wales and in lreland,
think that it is quality.⁵ lt might be said just as well that·the Sacra·
ment consiste ol smell‚ resistance, taste, dac. and the error would be
no greater than when it is set down as mere quantity or a bundle
ol accidents oi different lrinds. lt we consider the matter closely, we
shall see that all these opinions agree in giving the Sacramenta nature
infinitely more abject than the vilest bodily substance that can be named.⁶

By all these different opinions, we pay but very little honour
to this sacrament; lor the true veneration due to it consists in
following Christ by a lile ol poverty and holiness, and the contempt
ol all worldly things: which is lar better than the Host. l'et we
think little oi this, and invent for Christ’s body the vilest ol vestments,
and say He has taken lor Himsell a sign ol such nature, that He may
be adored beneath it.² Eut what gloss cando away with that canon

¹ Timendo istem persecut-ionem severam protestatus sum publice quod volo
humiliter corrigi ... per episcopos qui docuerint in ista materia veritatem. Sed volo
querere signum unde doctrine quarn assumunt fideliter possum confidere. ²un-
nam non libret suos usurarios ad infernum! Ἐκ sic maior pars ecclesie ad
ponderositatem hostie declinabit, cum quasi per totam cantuariensem protinciam
servabitur iste usus. ⁴Cui (diocesi lincolniensi) dicitnr iste usus competere.
5Εῑ hic usus in Vallia montuosa et Hibernia, ubi vident mortuos, est famosus.
⁶ Omnes tamen isti in hnc conveniunt quod hoc sacramentum est infinitum abiectioris
nature quam aliqua vilis substancia corporea assignanda. ⁷ Modicum honoramus
hoc sacramentnm, cum honor ille stat in imitacione Christi in moribus, in vita pauperi
et periali et in mundi ahieccione. Quod licet sit infinitum melius hostia, parum attendimus,
sed tinginrns mendaciter indumentum abiectissimum corpori Christi competere et ac·
cumulamus mendacium dicentes Christum signum istius nature ad cultum suum statuere.
