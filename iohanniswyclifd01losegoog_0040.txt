uf the Decretals, which says that the sacrament is bread and
wine?

T he Doctors os the Church, Raban Maur, Angustiae, John
Damascolus, whose words are quoted by Wyclif, all agree as cothis
point. lt is therefore an ancient doctrine, held by these Saints, that the
form, figure and ‘species’ of‘bread and wine is the Sacrament; by these
. three names they understand the essence or quiddityof bread and wine.¹

From what precedes it follows that the Bishops are bound,
under pain ol losing their temporalium, to investigate and find out
what the Sacrament is in itself3 otherwise, they are not able to teach
the people intrusted to their care. And the others, who defend such
‘aeros’ (tales cifras) all of them run the danger oi damnation. ln
concluding this chapter, Wyclif says: We find that God does not destroy
the material essence but changes it into something better, keeping
its nature intact. And who we care so much for signs, should do
so too. Christ commanda us to taste the Host, as the image of our
spiritual lood.

ln Ch. Vll (pp. 189-232) there is an attach upon the doctrine
oi identification, by which mere bread and wine become identically
Christ’s body and blood. lt was invented by Peter Lombard and has
many fallacious reasons and testimonies ol Saints in its favour, if
those testimonies are to be understood from a sophist's point ol view.
Against it Wyclif has seven arguments, oi which we only give one,
to show his mode oi reasoning. He says: Bread and wine will not become
what they will not be. But they will not be identically Christ's
body and blood, therefore they will not become so; for ii they will
be identical parts oi Christ, they are so already: whatever is
about to be, is. He elsewhere puts forward the following difficulty:
This sacrament being ior one person whiteness (albedo), for another,
quality, ior a third, quantity, dc„ each of them would be Christ and
identified with Him; thus, in one and the sante Host, this identification
would cause many sacramenta, oi which the number would be in·
definitely great, each ot them differing in kind from the others.² There
