lN'l'RODUCTlON. xxi

in which these words should be understood. lt suifices that the believer
should know that the bread and wine are figuratively Christ’s body
aad blood. Apious layman‚ il predestined‚ would be consequently '⁹
apriest, and have power to make (conficere) this Sacramenr; but the
Church has ordained, lrorn motives that are obvious, that priests
alone, on account ol their piety and ol their holy lile, should be the
ministers ol the Eucharist.¹ itis true that a pious layman who never
saw a Host might receive Out Lord's body more efficaciously thau
apriect; lor, in St. Augustine's words, “to receive Christ is to believe
ia llim. Why then dost thou prepare thy tecth and stomachi believe,
and thou hast received Him'’. Only spiritual leeding on Christ is
indispensable, and that consists in the grateful and pious contemplation
ol what Christ has suffered for mankind.

hlany are unlavourably impressed at the thought ol what slight
cllect would belong to the sacramentul words if nothing was produced
by them, and no change made: a doctrine which is besides contrary
to theCanons ol the Church, and especially to the words ol Ambrose,
who says that the bread becomes the body ol Christ. But this saint

did aot mean that the bread became identically Christ's body, only
its ellectual representation. So this conversion destroys neither the
nature ol thebread nor that ol Christ's body by introducing another
material esseoce; it merely produces the presence ol the body ol
Christ and takes away from the bread its ‘chielness’, so that
all the ardour ol the worshippers is coacentrated upon Christ
present.

This is the only view ol ‘conversion’ approved by St. Ambrose3
this alone can give peace to the mind ol the priest. lt is falsely
atfirned that a perceptible change takes placeio the bread, in order
10 represent effectively the body ol Christ. And the man who cannot
understand this mode ol figurative speech will be able to make nothing
ol the Futhers and ol Holy Writ, even when speaking literally.
