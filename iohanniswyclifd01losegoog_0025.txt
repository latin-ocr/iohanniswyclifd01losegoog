substantiation took place, the bread and wine would be destroyed:¹
so much bread and wine as is thus transubstantiated in the whole
world censes to be; this would be a fatal transmutation, lor the
bread as it was belore is ol more use to the world than this “awlul '
change”. He continues developing his theme. Neither reason nor
revelation teaches man that such a change takes place; yet, according
to St. Augustine, all truth is contained in Scriptute. lt is therefore
the duty oi the Elders ol the Church to examine the foundation oi
this doctrine, that we may not be burdened by useless novelties.
And since we find nothing ol the doctrine of Transubstantiation
either in Scriptura, reason, or revelation, we are no more obliged to
believe in it than was the primitive Church. At the present day,
Augustine’s teaching is contradicted3 and· it is said that we do not
receive the body ol Out Lor'd in bread and wine, but in mere unknown
accidents. Since God decreed to make so great a present to us, it
was meet that it should be made under a veil ol honour, by which
every illusion might be excluded.² But our inward and outward senses
cry aloud that what remains alter consecration is bread and wine: so
God, giving to man so precious a gilt, has accompanied it by an
illusion: n conclusion that is inadmissible.

The present doctors are much exercised to express their doctrine
in proper words; but nobody is able as yet to deline transubstantiation,
orsay in what it differs lrom annihilation³ lt might perhaps be allowed
to adore those accidents, called by some bread and wine, as signs
ol the presence ol Christ's body and blood; but as the Fathers ol
the Old Law took heed not to worship images as God, so must
every Christian beware not to adore such accidents as Christ; lotas
the graven images had no power to keep the former iront the attacks

¹ Non est Dei destruere suam fabricam in auctorisando ecclesiastica sacra-
menta; sed sic laceret iusta sentenciam noviter adinventam ergo ista est irracionabilis.
²Cum ergo Deus decrevit nobis dare donum tarn magnum, videtur convenire
sue veritati magnifice qnod dedit nobis ipsunt in valamento honorifico, illusionem
hominis excludente. Omnis enirn talis decepcio est mala sensus iudicant de.
strhstanciis materialibus, ideo magis malum soret in illis decipi. ³'unde hic
angustiantur moderni doctores, curn quibus signis vere exprimerent veritatem huius
sacramenti unde omnes legiste nesciunt describere transsubstanciacionem et
quomodo ab ennicltilaeione distinguitur.
