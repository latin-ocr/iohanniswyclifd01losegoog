Nor ought we to buy the prayers of priests for money, but rather,

The Communion ol Our Lord’s body censius, not in the mere
bodily reception, touehing or eating of the consecrated lloat, butiri
the feeding of the soul upon that faith which brings forth fruit. Τ his
manner of nourishing the soul was unknown to many disciples ut
the time when they said: “This is a hard saying; who can understand
iti’' and therefore they went astray. Can anything be more horrible
than to he compelled to eat the flesh and blood of our Creator,
whom we love so tenderly? lt is indispensably necessary for the
faithful firmly to believe that the soul is nourished by a food that
is purely spiritual.

From Christ's words, as expounded by St. augustine, three
corollaries may be deduced.'·' l. We only rahe spiritually Christ’s body
and blood. ll. Neither on animal nor a man eternally foreknown to
