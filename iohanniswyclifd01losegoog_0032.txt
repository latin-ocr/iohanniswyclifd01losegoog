blindness to abandon the Guspcls aud the fathers, aud ιο l'ollow tho
guidunce oi heretical decretals, which lay down as a rule that the
words “under bread and wine'' should be taken to mean, not the
substance or nature, but the mere accidents. None of the Saints could
possibly have meant that the bread is radically consumed and destroyed
by the benediction aud power oi the words of Christ3 it is rather
changed ior the better. God cannot cause the destruction oi such a
substance without any compensation.¹ The faithful may therefore grant
that the sacrament of the Eucharist is in reality bread and wine; or,
as others. say, a compouud ol that substance aud oi Our Lord's body.
This aggregate is produced by the power of the Divine blessing, so that
there is nothing destroyed by the consecration ol the bread and wine.²

Wyclit‘ then refutes the difficulties proceeding from quotations
out oi Anselm, Ambrose and Hugo. Anselm and the other Saints
cared less to honour the uutward sign than to increase devotion to
. what the sign signifies‚ that is, Christ’s body and thus Christ Ηίιοεοίιζ3
No accident can exist without a subject, as Augustino points out
both in his Dialogues and elsewhere.⁴ Bonuveutura's theory that ior
the salte of popular devotiori and the reverence ducto the Sacra·
ment many things nrust be maintained t'or which we have no Scripture
warrant, is utterly inadntissible.⁵ When Augustino says that this Sacra·
ment is almost universally called the body oi Christ,· he does uot
intend to suggest that this implies the destruction oi' the bread, or
that it does not remaiu iu its essence. When a new Pope is elected,
he taltes a new namc3 the former man is not destroyed, but lost
sight oi.⁶ And if it bc objected that many Saints have believed in
