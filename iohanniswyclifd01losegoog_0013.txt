lNTRODUC'l'lON.

He first discovered that the doctrine of Transubstantiation did
not tally with the expressions used by Holy Writ. Wherever the
subject occurs, we invariably remark that the same bread which lesus
Christ took in his hands aod gave to his disciples to eat, is his Body.
lt is ol real bread that Christ said: “This is My Body''; and the pronoun
“hoc” obviously stands for the bread. ln many places the Apostle
Paul gives it that name. lf lesus said ol John the Baptist that he was
Elias, he did not on that account cease to be John; and when He
says of Himself: “l arn the vine’', this is to he understood, not in a
corporal, but ina figurative sense. That the bread remains aster con·
secration is the general tradition of the Charch, is maintained hy its
most weighty Doctors, persistently asserted by reason, and proved by
the very testimony of our senses.

Wyclif, while inveighing against the ‘new' doctrine oi Tran-
substantiation‚ also attempted to raise his voice against certain ‘heatheu'
ideas which had found entrance into the Church and were gaining
strength every day; according to these ideas, due to interested promoters,
every priest was able to ‘rivalte’ the body ol God. The idea that a
priest could ‘malae God' appeared blasphemous to Wyelif, as Lechler
very justly observes,¹ first, because it ascribes to the priest an
unnatural power, hy which a creature gives being to his Creator, a
siniul nran to the l·loly of llolies3 second, because it is degrading to
God to say that He, the Eternal one, can be created every day; and
lastly, because by this doctrine the Holy Sacrament is prolaned and
the abomination ol desolation reigns in high places. “The Host'’, he
complains, “is worshipped3 the creature instead ol the Creator''. He
denounces with servent zeal the idolatry² that takes place in the
modern charch, where the Host is not merely honoured, but openly
adored3 whereas adoration is due only to the eternal God. This
adoration ol the Host is yet further aggravated by the sact that divine
honours are paid to an object which is said to be only an accident
