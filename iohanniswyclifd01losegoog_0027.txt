Christ's body and blood; but Christ, the best ol Teacbers, the “Caesar

semper augustum, in the Last Suppes, alter the purely figurative

repast ol the Passovet, instituted this sacrament at the most solemn

moment ol· His lile. And hence it has more ellicacy audisio nearer

relation to Christ tban any sacrament ol the Old st. lt excels thern

all lrom a threelold point ol view: t. in that Christ’s body is actually
” present3¹ a. in the invisible power to produce Christ’s presence that
belongs to the visible sacrament,² and 3. io that it uaites all membera
ol the Church with Christ, and is thus ol greater utility than other
sacramenta to him that offers it to God in the right way.⁸ lts figures
were in the Old Law: r. the sacrificial lamb; s. tlae water that sprang
hom the barren rock, and 3. the manna, to which this sacrament
and that which it contains (res sua) is much superior. Ol the manna,
Christ says: Your fathers did eat and are dead; he that cateth oi
this bread will live etemally.

The real power ol the words oi consecration, what ia to be⁸

pendia), men must prepare⁸ themselves to receive Christ worthily,
are subsequently dealt with.

Wyclii examines only the two first points in this chapter; a sepa·
rate investigation oi the third point is reserved lor Ch.Vl.

Aa ior the words oi consecration, they have no power to produce
any change (efficaciam convertendi). God, in whose name they are
spoken, is the only agent throughout. The pronoun ‘hoc' stands lor
bread. Different Evangelists give the sacramental words in adifferent
manner: whence it follows that there is no necessary and unchangeable
formula lor consecration⁴ We must especially attend to the spirit
