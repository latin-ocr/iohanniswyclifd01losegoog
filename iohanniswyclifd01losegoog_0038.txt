the doctors burden the Church with dogmas, they should'take the
matter into serious consideration, and‘ understand in what manner
this sacrament rather than all others takes away sins, and gives grace
both to the living and the dead. lt makes us to become worthy ol
God’s help by nomines, and to learn that there is no other name
on earth by which we must bc saved, but that of Christ, who is tto
respectet ol persons.¹

ll complaint is made that Wyclil treats all who believe in Tran-
substantiation as heretics, who ought to be shunned and even severely
punisbed, it may be justly replied that the clergy, changing tlte
truth ol tlte Gospel, deal treacherously towards their neighbour.
Rishops should therefore make every endeavour to understand the
question concerning Our Lord's body; otherwise, adoring what they
know not, they lall blindly into the ditch ol idolatry, and drag the
Church into it with them.² There would surely not have been so
rnuch written ort this subject, il the Church, and the Bishops especially,
were not bound to teach tlte trnth to the laithlul.³ lt would be
shameless il our Bishops, who know perlectly well the stamps on
gold and silver coins, know nothing about this sacrament3 and yet
by this knowledge, infinitely more perfect than their ecclesiastical
dignity, being that wisdom which hateth ignorante, they could buy
the kingdom ol Heaven.

What should we think ol a prelate who would care more lor
the form and substance ol a coin, lor the outward appearance ol a
scal or a privilege, than lor the entity ol tlte consecrated ΗοςῑὲΙ
Those are indeed to be blamed who accuse good prelates groundlessly;
but on the other hand, such prelatas as persecute tlte good cause ol
laith are inexcusable: their worldly possessions ought to be taken
away l'rotn them, lor the man who worships a deceitlul sign rather
than Christ's body does not even deserve to live, still less to possess
