knowledge of Scripture can be taken as a witness to truth. - Wyclif -
subsequently examines the opinions of the Doctors of the Church
concerning Transubstantiation. Lanfranc of Bec’s arguments against
the remaining of the bread are not satisfactory.¹

At the time ol Lanfranc and Gultmundus, there was no decree
of the Church of Rome against this opinion.² The fourth council of
Ephesus had already condemned as heretical the folly of some who
contended that there is present in the Host, not the living flesh of
Christ, but that of every righteous man.

Many Saints, it is argued, held this doctrine; but on the other
hand, many more, from the very earliest times, believed exactly the
contrary.⁸ Yet we despise their life, actions and writings, and prefer
, the opinions and deeds of the moderns. ·

Scriptura, the Fathers‚ and the Canens of the Church use the
term bread; we must therefore use the same term, and following
their reaching, say that, speaking of the ‘accidents of breud’ they
mean the broad itself.⁴ hs regards the Decretal, if not grounded on
Scriptute, 'it is useless; besides, its laws are unjust, lor it now and
then is the pleasure ol the Pope to abolish them. ln so far as the
l'ope grounds his decisions on Scriptura, we believe him. Moreover,
neither Peter nor any ol the other Apostles took upon themselves
any power ol commanding the others, but in doubtful cases they
consulted God by casting lots.

The second objection refers to the truth ulthe Sacramental
words. We must grant their absolute truth. They always speak of
bread and wine. Transubstantiation, identification and impanation
are shown to be impossible. They can therefore be true only in a
figurative sense3 that is they represent ‘sacramentaliter’ the body of

¹lste autem Lanfrancus licet fuerit sanctus, in sue invectione inartificiose
procedit ... simulat falsa, contra que procedit. ² hnte lanfrancum et Gultmundum
non erant aliqua decreta ecclesie contraria huic sentencie. 1Νιιιι obiecta sunt
nobis scriptura sacra et sancti doctores prestantiores et prudenciores curn dictis suis
qui floruerunt in primitiva ecclesia. ⁴ Cum ergo scriptura sacra et saneti demeres
curn lege ecclesie sic locuntur, nos debemus indubie sic loqui ad sensum eorum et
glossare eos quod per accidens intelligunt ipsum partein.
