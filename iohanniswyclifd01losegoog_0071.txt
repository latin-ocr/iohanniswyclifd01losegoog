1 .le INTRODUCTION.

24· De Antichristo.
25. Dialogus.
26. Trialogus.

Dr. Herzberg-Frlinckel sentus the three Vienna MSS. in one copy,

with the different collatione. The letters A, Β, C, by which Ι hare
called the MSS. does not in any way reler to their respective value.
l only chose this lettering because compelled to do so by the nature
of the copy and collation. C's text is the best oi the three MSS. in
so far as it corrects the mistaltes oi the two former. The Vienna
MSS. sortn a separate group from those ol Prngue. The numerous
mistakes ol A and B which are corrected by C, are mostly wanting
in the latter.

4. The tractate de Eucharistiae is to be found besides in a paper
lolio MS. (numbered D) in the Prague University Library (Ν. D. 22)
that contains: (1) Wyclil's Summa Theologicn‚ (2) De mandatis
divinis (itote-roff) Each page is divided into two columns3 there
are no marginal notes nor¹ abstract of contenta. The MS. tras written
out by Andreas of Kourim (n town in bohemia), in the years
1404—1405; lor at the end ol the hrst treatise we find the following
words: “Et sic est finis huius decalogi feria quarta post festum sancti
Matthie apostoli sub anno domini Millesimo Quadringintesimo quinto
per manus Andree de Gourym finitus.”

5. Another MS. (Ε) small 4¹⁰, is also to be found in the
University Library (xl. Ε. 3) This volume contains a great many
treatises by many different hands, certainly oi the XV¹h Century.
De Eucharistiae begins on folio 15³, ending nt 54⁸, and was copied
in a very etamped and illegible hand, in 1460 as is stated on 54³, at
the end ol this treatise: “Amen, dec. tx⁰ dominica post Omnium Sanc-
torum Deo gracias. Explicit tractatus mayor de Eucharistia Magistri
Johutmis W. Sequitur minor de Eucharistia eiusdem.” This MS. has
been described by huddensieg, in his preface to John Wyclil’s pole·
micul works (Leipsic 1883), pp. LIV· LVI. There are no marginal
notes in this manuscript either. One oi the two Prague MSS, Egives
tho best and most reliable text os all thc live. Ι had the advan-
tage ot a most cateiul collation oi the two last by Mt. Patern in
Prague.
