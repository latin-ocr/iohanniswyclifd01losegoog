rlre not all these articles taken word for word from the present
tractate De Eucharistiu?

Α certain Lollard‚ named Peter Payne, escaped from England to
llohenria. Bohernian authors mostly call him Petrus de Anglia‚ the ⁵
Germana, Peter Englisch.¹ All his life heremained afaithful follower
of Wyclif and most fearlessly defended his master’s doctrines against
all adversaries, even against lohann of Ρηίϋτιηι.2 The latter says
of him: “l do not approve of the endeavours in defence of Wyclif
made by ‘Magister' Peter of England, that foreigner in Bohemia,· for
he attempta in every way to defend the writings of John Wyclif,
particularly in the question concerning the body of Christ. 1 especially
disapprove of those writings in which Peter Payne, following the
spirit and even the very words of Wyclif, denies that Christ’s body·
is trulv and really in the Sacrament of the Altar.³

“Non'' continues Praibram‚ “can l assent to those statutes
of the Taborite priests that have this year been promulgated, in
which, following the example of Peter Payne and John Wyclif, they
admit the doctrine of the latter about the Eucharist, and especially
uphold the pernicious tenet that in the Sacrament there remains
material bread.”⁴

“l also dissent frona the short treatise ou the body of the Lord,
written by Nicholas of Pehlrzimow, the so·called bishop of the
Taborites‚ in which he admits as true the opinions of Wyclif and
Payne.”³ The substance of this treatise is known; Nicholas sent a
copy to Peter of Chelczicz. lt is quite true that it contains the pure
doctrines of Wyclif. The treatise is in the MS. of the Chaptcrhouse,
Prague (Cod. l). 119).⁰ ⁶

Johaun of Praibram also quotes two works of Martinelt: llle
