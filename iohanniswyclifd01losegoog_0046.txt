INTRODUCTION. xxxix

The doctrine ol impanation is therefore heretical, because it
contradicts Scripture and the Fathers, because the entity of bread
cannot he the entity of flesh, and also because tlte Church carinot,
without good and serious reasons, be burdened in matters of faith.¹

We may shorten our synopsis of Ch. Vlll, because Wyclif has ’
already dealt with the same s'ubject in De Apostasia, where it is
divided into two chapters.² lt is impossible, he says, that one and
the same body can be at one and the same instant (simul et semel)
in several different places. The question is riot how a Universal or
’ species can be multiplied in its innumerable individuale, but ho'w one
and the same indivitlual can, numerically the same, exist separately
in distinct parts of space; justas the soul is said to exist at once
in every part of the human body, and as the faithful say that Christ
is present, in soul aud body, in many thurches and on many altars
at the same time. That is called the “Multiplication’' of tlte body,
for it is asserted that the whole body ol Christ is at every point of
the consecrated host. There are two opposite opinions on this sub·
ject: that ol' Duas Scotus, who says that one aad the same body can, ι
numerically and dimensionally, be multiplied in many places3 and the
opinion of St. Thomas Aquinas, according to whom it can be multi· ·
plied only in the following manner: iu one place, spacially and
dimensionally, and in another disconnected place, potentially and
sacramentally: as Christ who exists dimensionally in Heaven, and is
present sacramentally indifferent places at once. Alter along digression
tpp. 233-268), Wyclif, returning to the main point, aclrnowledges
the second opinion as the true one,³ and accordingly asserts that
Christ’s body remains in Heaven according to its dimensione in space,
and is by His power and action present in the Host, as in a sign.⁴
As to the presence itself, there are also various opinions. One is that
Christ’s body is esseutially present only there, the word ‘only’ referring

¹ Cum ergo ista impanatio non hahet evidentiam ex scriptura, ex racione vel
ex testimonio dante iidem, videtur quod katholicus pru evitando periculo uon debet
impanationem'talem asserere. ² De ‚lpostasim ch. lilll, lx. ³ Sed redeundo
post disgressionem ad difficultatem tactam de multiplicacione‚ videtur quod secunda
sentencia sit tenendastll ⁸ Et sic patet de corpore Christi quod est dimensionalite
in celo et virtualiter in hostia ut in signo. 221
