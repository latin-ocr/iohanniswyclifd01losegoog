INTRODUCTION.

ln the third part he deberes the question whether Christ can be

seen in the Sacrament by bodily eyes in the very same manner as
Wyclif. There are, however passages in which certain authors are
quoted whose names do not occur in Wyclif, so far as l know. The
fourth part — whether Christ can be touched in the sacrament -
is very like a repetition of the first chapter; and the fifth concerns
the reception of the Body of Christ. ln this place he has inserted the
sentence with which Wyclif begins his trectise3 but he does not draw
his conclusione therefrom with the same acumen.

Wyclif, p. rr: llus, fol. cratvr:

ln qua materia dixi sepe populo quod Pro quo sciendum quod in sacn-
in sacramento altaris est tria considerare, mento altaris est dare tria, scilicet sacra·
scilicet nudum sacramentum, sic quod non mentum et non rem ut illud sensibile;
rem sacramenti, ut hostiam consecratam Sacramentum et rem ut est corpus do-
secundo sacramentum et rem sacramenti minicum. Tercio rem ct non sacramen-
ut verum corpus Christi et sanguinent, ct tum, ut est unio membrorum ecclesie.
tercio rem sacramenti et non sacramen-
tum ut unionem Christi cum corpore suu
nristico qtrod est ccclesia ...

We are thus in a position ιο prove the influence of Wyclif’s
Eucharistic doctrine upon Hos, which proof is confirmed by the
statements of his contemporaries, both friendly and hostile; but we
must admit that, like his later opponents, Stanislaus von Znaim and
Stephen von Palecz, he did not hold to them very long. lt is quite
clear, from all his declarations in the Council of Constance, that he
had abandoned them. He even denied that he had ever taught them3
which, as we have already seen, is not exact. lhave elsewhere given
proofs to show that it was ιιοι the Calixtines - the moderate Hus-
sites — but the extreme party of the Taburitcs, that took up the
doctrine of Wyclif, abandoned by the former; they therefore appear
as the only true Wyclifists.¹ They alone faitlrfully adhered to his
beliefs concerning the Lord's Supper. Should information on the sub·
ject bc required, it will suffice to peruse the great chronicles of the
Taborites‚ by Jobann Lukawe'cz und Nicholas ΡιΙΙιιιῐιιιοιιι.2
