seen in the iiost. And now let ns ask the authors of these false
miracles whether Christ in the iiost is sitting or standing, and of
what colottr, quantity aad quality His body is. They will answer that
all depends on the colour, form and quantity of the Host. So our
God would be in orte Host round and short, and in another long
and broken, and would thus be made up of occidental components
that change continttally; and thus we could make a God for ourselves
as we chose.¹ '

As it is with sight, so with hearing. The host is broken, but
Christ is not; and so of the other sauses. Can any idea be more
heathenish than to say that if the elements are soar, stinking, or
rotten, the same adjectives appiy to God? God would then be rotten
and stinking in village churches, fresh and street in churches of the townl²

Atrful consequences would follow fronr the doctrine of the
bodily presence of Christ in the Sacrament. For we must then con·
clude that the perceived form, which we cali the Sacramettt, is not the
fiesh and blood of Christ.³ l'et such is the doctrine ol the Holy
Fathers: of Ambrose, Angustiae, &a A Decreta} indeed seems to
stand in the way; but we must not take such decretale literally, but
understand the sense of such expressions as ‘the bread is the body
of the Lord’; which must of course be taken figuratitely. And if sonte
wine has been spilt out of the chalice, we should not therefore
believe that Christ's blood is spilt. Rererrgarius' recantation is in
agreement with this doctrine; also many sentences of the Saints and
of Charch services.⁴ We therefore conclude from all this that the
sacrament has the form of bread and wine, but is neither Christ nor
a part of ilina. The sacrament is the Host, and iesus Christ is hidden
therein in a supernatural manner.⁶
