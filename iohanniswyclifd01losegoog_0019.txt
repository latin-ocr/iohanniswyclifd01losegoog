idolatry. The people would soon go the length ol really adoring as
God the chalice that contains Christ’s blood, or the wood on which
His body hangs. Our ardent devotion should not be spent on the
chalice that the priest elevares at Mass, nor to the Host that we per·
ccive‚ but to the Sacrament that is contained therein.¹ Were this error
destroyed, God would be worshipped much more perlectly; it would
be known that He is present, but hidden in the sacrament. ls he aot
adored with purer and truer piety in every creature that we see?

But another objection is started here. The priestly authority
would be damaged, il the privilege to ‘make the body and blood of
Christ' were not admitted to exist;² or ii laymen knew that saith
sees the Deity in every creature more than in the Host, and thus
receives the body ol the Lord by the contemplation of llis creatures.
Who would then care to hear Mass? who would hire mass-sayers
(missantes) for large sums ol money, or take the Sacrament according
to the rites of the Church?

The answer is, that even alter the destruction ol this error,
priestly power would still continue to exist, within due limits. Nothing
can be more nwlul than that any priest can nrake the body ol the
Lord by saying Mass.³ What the pricst makes is merely the con·
sectation of the Host, which is not the body ol the Lord, but only
the active sign ol His presence. This consecration is certainly ol
greater importauce than the consecration ol a chalice ora sacerdotal
vestment‚ a privilege reserved to the Rishop alone. lt sulfices lor the
maintenance ol the priest's authority that he should give the blessing
and consecrate or ‘make' the sacrament, which, as the Host, though
not Christ’s body, is its sign nnd covering. He therefore does not
make the body ol Our Lord, but only the sacrament, and deserves

¹ This, says Wyclif, is the signification ol the Church hymn:
Sub diversis speciebus,
Signis tantum et non rebus,
latent res eximie.

²Tercio obiciunt per hoc, quod sic vilesceret sacerdotalis potestas, cum non
hahet potestatam consecrandi vel faciendi corpus Christi vel sanguinem. ³ Nihil
enim horribilius quam quod sacerdos celebrans lacit vel consecrat cotidie cor-
pus Christi. Nam Deus noster non est Deus recens nec corpus suum noviter
laciendum.
