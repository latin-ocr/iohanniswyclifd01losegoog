De dominio civili he still holds the traditional doctrine os tran·
substantiation. “The doctrine of the ‘making ol Christ's Body’,” says
Lechler, “was obviously and nairely set forth by Wyclif, since he
says in a passage in which he describes Christ as the eternal Proplret,

Priest and King: ‘He was a l‘riest when, in the last supper, lle made
his own Body’.”1 ln another part of the same work he uses expres·
sions that are yet more categorical: “The priest'', he says, “makes
the body of Christ; i. e. by the words ol consecration he makes the
body ol Christ to be present under the accidents.”² We haue here the
very doctrine that Wyclif attacks in his latest works with so great
and, we may say, with so fierce animation. The points upon which
he lays most stress are, in contradiction with his former belief τ t. That
the bread exists alteras before consecration, neither Transubstantia·
tion, ldentification nor lmpanation (as the technical theological terms
stand) taking place. 2. The body oi Christ is present in the Host
aiter the consecration. Remaining bread in the natural sense even
then, it is in a figurative and sacramental sense Christ's body. Christ's
Body end His Blood are therefore really and truly present — present
in a threefold aspect, virtual, sacramental and spiritual - and no
change in the Host is admissible except in so iar as the elements are
not mere empty signs, but active realities. We receive Christ’s Body
and Blood, not only corporally and substantially, but also in a spirit·
ual manner, by saith. Thereby we partake of the sacramental presence
oi Christ, which is by itselia miracle, produced by the words oi
consecration. “lt is the laith ol the Charch”, says Wyclis, “that, as
lesus Christ is at the same time God and man, so the sacrament is
at once the Body oi Christ and bread; bread in the natural, Christ's
Body in the sacramental sense; or, more bri‘elly: The sacrament of the
altar is Christ's blood and body ander the form ol bread and wine”.³

llow did Wyclit come to change his religious convictions thus,
and what date may we assign to his first public announcements ol'
this change?
