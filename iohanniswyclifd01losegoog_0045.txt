perception ol the Eucharist is not directed upon tbe bread, but upon
Christ‘s body, which is in Heaven. And when the Saints affirm that
the qualities alone remain, they can mean nothing else.¹

ln the fourth part ol Cb. Vll. Wyclil treats ol impanation, os
which he gives a delinition that is not very satisfactory. l=le says:
impanation is the act by which bread becomes Christ’s body; in-
vination the act by which wine becomes His blood.² lt would have
been much preferable to say that Christ‘s blood becomes wine and

His body, bread; just as God becomes man by the lucarnation.

’ The teachers of the doctrine ol impanation rely upon a passage
ol St. Angustiae, which is however, misinterpreted by them. ll rightly
understood, it militates in lavdur ol the doctrine maintained by
wyctit.³ Resides, Augustine says expressly that tlte body ol Christ
is concealed itt tlte Sacrament, and that he is not seen by bodily
eyes. And he sets this lorth yet more clearly, when he says: The
heavenly bread that is really the flesh of Christ is in a certain manner
called Christ's body, being-in reality a sacrament of the body ol
Christ.⁴ The Gloss remarks that this heavenly sacrament, as it
represents the flesh ol Christ, is called Christ’s body, bttt improperly
(improprie). Augustine says: “As the sacrifice ol the Body, offered
up by the priest's hands, is called Christ's sufferings, llis death and
crucifixion, not according to the reality of tlte thing but in a mystic
sense, so the sacrament ol saith, baptism, is called laith itsell.'' And
Augustine explains his meaning still more clearly, saying that the
consecrated Host seems to be Christ's body alter the manner of a
sign, being its figurative and sacramental representation. There is thus
no doubt that Augustine, speaking ol bread, means its natural essence,
not an accident, ol which he says most expressly (tam expresse) that
tt has no scil-existence.⁶ Ambrose speaks to the same effect.

¹ Er ad istum sensum videntur sancti dicere quod in hostia solum remanent
qualitates. ¹Unde quidam vocant impanacionem qua panis tit caro Christi, ct
invinacionem quarinum titsanguis Christi, sicut vocant incarnacionem qua caro
fir licus ³ lstud decretum cum glossa sua magis lacit pro nostra sentencia.
*Panis celestis quivere cst caro Christi stto modo vocatur corpus Christi, cunt
revera sit sacramentum corporis Christi. ⁶ Nec dubium quin Augustinus intendit
per panem naturam panis, non accidens quod tam expresse aperit nnn posse per se esse.
