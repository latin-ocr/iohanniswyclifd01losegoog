ιο space, so that ile is not at ali present unless present with fiis
dimensions. Another admits the former position of presence without
dimensium, because this is at leaat more comprehensible tban the
accident theory. But however this may be, Wyclif affirms his will·

‘ ingness to submit, if it be shown him that his own doctrine is

erroneous, superfluous, or insufficient: it is most astounding bowj since
Church endowrnent has prevaiied, men have perverted the doctrine of
tire Sacrament, without arry foundation, either reasonable or revealed‚
for such a change. By riteh means the whole body of Catholic doctrine
might'be perverted in like manner.¹

ln Ch. 1x, Wyciif passer ιο the refutationes seven objections
made against his doctrine of the remaneoce of the bread.² iiirst, it
is said that it contradicts the decision of Pope innocent and of 315
bishops‚ which all the faithful ought to believe. lt may be repiied
that we have nothing to show us with certainty that the intention of
innocent and his bishops was really such as is supposed} Again‚ wc
do not irnow whether he and the other bishops were members of tire
Church, which consists oi none but the elect. it may bc that none
of them was of that number. By what reason then can it be maintained
that obedience ιο the Church impiies obedience to them?⁴ Their
decision is insufficient as concerns the doctrine of Transubstantiation;
vit is a fact that the dogma presents very great difficulties⁵ We may
believe no Church, not even an angel from Heaven, if thc assertion is
'not founded upon reason orScripture. The doctrine of our adversaries
has no warrant in either; we must therefore set it aride.

if there is nothing to support Transubstantiation but the Decretai,
its foundations are indeed weak. Pope innocent himself has not the
¹best of reputations. None has donc so much ιο pervert the Holy
Scriptores, in order to taire all temporal power from hymen, and

consecracionem remaneat vei quod sacramentum non sit accidens sine subiecto.

innocencii curn tot prelatis. iNon docetur quod ipse rel iiii fuerunt membra
ecclesie, sed ex sibi dubio nulius iliorum fuit predestinatus. ⁵C0nsenciendurn
