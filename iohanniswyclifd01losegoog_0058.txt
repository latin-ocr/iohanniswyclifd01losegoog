INTRODUCTION. l.l

“There are some,” he says, “who deny that Christ is this bread, and say
that the body nithe L0rd is broken, ground with the teeth, torn,
divided into parts, eaten corporally, seen with bodily eyes, and touched
by the hands ol men.”

Contradicting this belief, he teaches that Christ is bread3 in
favour of which doctrine be adduces agreatmany Scripture quotations.
w5ctif, throughout the first chapter of the tractate which bears a
similar name, attempts to prove that the body ol the Lurd cannot
be broken, just as it is impossible to break a sunbeam by breaking
the glass or the piece ol crystal through which it passes (p. 12);
only the bread is broken, the Lord’s body remains untouched by
our teeth (Wyctilz nec conterimus dentibus· corpus Christi; lius:
dentibus conteri); that He cannot be seen by the bodily eye (Wyclifz
quod non videmus in sacramento illo eorpus Christi oculo corporali,
sed oculo mentali; Hus: oculis corporalibus videri). Wyclif says that
Christ is seen, not with material, but with spiritual, vision, and Hus
uses the same expressions: Pro isto dubio est notandum quod duplex
est risio (Wyctih est dare duplicem visionem) scilicet sensitiva et
spiritualis (Wyclilz scilicet corporalem et spiritualem).

ln the next chapter, Hus teaches that Christ is brcad, but he
does not answer in lull the question put by a Wyclil the beginning
of his second chapter: Restat videre quid ipsum (sacramentum) sit
realiter. His answer is: Panis est corpus Christi, hoc est, signum
sacramentale eius.

“l ask,” says lius, “why Christ is called bread eleren times in
such and such a chapter, unless to impress this belief upon the hearts
ol the laithlu1.” Wyclil uses nearly the same language, examining the
passages in which Christ's body is called bread. Hus draws most ol
the arguments lor his opinions from Wyclif. - ln the second part
ol this chapter llus answers the question whether Christ’s body can
be broken, exactly in Wyclil's manner3 and here too he does not
take the trouble to bring together arguments from different authors,
but simply draws from Wyclil. lt would be quite foreign to the
purpose oi this Introduction to quote every argument one by one;
it is enough to note the lact that Hus has chosen, partly from the
first and partly from the second part ol Wyclil's De Eucharistia, the

arguments which he sets forth in this part ol his treatise.
