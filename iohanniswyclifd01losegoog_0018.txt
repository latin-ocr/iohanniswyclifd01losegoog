in the hymn, Larrdo, Sion: the sacrament can be broken, as we are
taught to do by the Rimul, but Christ's body is not; our senses
receive a lalse impression.

lt may indeed be objected that, it the consecrated Host were
not the body ol our Lord, we could neither see, nor eat, nor per·
ccii-e it in any way. But here we must obserre that, as there are
two kinds ol sight, eating, de, viz. that of the body and that ol the
soal, we must admit that we do not see the body ol Christ in the
sacrament with the bodily eye, but by the spiritual vision of saith,
‘as in a glass, darkly’.¹ As the image is perfect in every part of the
mirror, so it is with the body of the Lord in the consecrated Host.
Our hands do not corporully touch and break the Lord's body3 our

unbeliel: it is a sorni of idolatra· hy which a most base (valde abiecta)
creature is worshipped as their God. 'l'his error must be eradicated.
Do we not extract the thorn t'rotn the loot, the arrow lrom tlte wound,
in order to prevent a worse evil? lt is the duty oi Bishops to stamp
out such heresy; il they do not, they thentselces become guilty ol
heresy. And how can it be said that the knowledge ol the trutlt can
injure the people's devotioni “Far be it lrom us”, says the Apustio,
''to do evil that good raray conte’'. We are not allowed to commit
