gives us a chapter¹ on the various opinions ol men as to the causes
of the rebellion oi 1381. First among them he cites the laxity of the
bishops who, lrnowing that Wyctit and his lollowers were spreading
false doctrines concerning thesacrament os the altar far and wide
among the people, did not chastise their perverse children. lt was
for this neglect above all that the archbishop was punished, and the
lesaon was pointed by his martyrdom taking place on the day niter
Corpus Christi (r4June). There is no reason to doubt that we have
here an echo ol talk that was common at the tinae. But the vengeance
would be swiit, not to say hasty, which smote the archbishop on
¹4 June for not repressing heresies first pronrulgated in that summer.
indeed, it we may trust the expressions ol the chronicler, there had
been time sor the new opinions not merely to win a hasty condem·
nation from an old adversary at Oxlord, but to spread themselves
abroad through the country.

“One must not lay too much stress on such an argument as this;
but, with those already advanced, it is enough to overthrow the
authority oi the Fasciculi, especially when we remenrber that that
volume was not conrpiled till halla century later, arrd that even the
passages that appear to be written by a contemporary were not
penned before ¹39²· After a dozen years even an eyewitness might
easily confuse the date ol the condemnation with that oi the begin·
ning of the controversy.’'

Wyclif, having once for all completely rejected the Catholic
doctrine of Transubstantiation, continued to argue the matter with
unahnting activity. Almost all those oi his works that are later than
1380, whether in English or in Latin, whether written lor the people
or lor men oi learning, contain repeated allusions and attacks, lor
which, he says “God will give him a rich reward”.‘·' But his doctrine
ol the Eucharist is nowhere expounded so completely and so conr·
prehensively as in the present treatise, of which the following pages
contain a. brief summary.
