neside the Tractatos de Eucharistia maior, we find the Tractatos
minor, known to Wyclii's contemporaries. lt was, together with the
larger treatise, condemned to be burned in Prague. As it has been
comparatively lately (in 1858) reprinted by Shirley in the Fasciculi
zizaniorum, there is no need ior a new edition at the present time.
We should remark that the contenta oi both treatises agree in ali
points of importance, and the subject is only dealt with in the iesser
work in a more concise and more popular style. it is the sameas
2· 2⁰ oi Shiriey's Catalogue: De Eucharistie Confessio; and 22: De
Eucharistie conclusiones quindecim (Fascicuii zizaniorum, p. 105- 106).

ShirIey mentions (Νο 22) a longer treatise oi Wyclii, under the
title: Quaestio ad fratres de Sacramenta altai·is; it is to be iound in
the MS. ill. G. rt oi l’rague University. He justiy remarks that he
is not sure whether that is not rather five short treatises than n
single one. Only the first chapter — 28 lines in all -treats oi the
Sacrament3 the iew notes to be seen come, in all probability, from
the pen oi a Bohemian Wyciifite. The following pages deal with
very different subjects: first there is an explanation oi the words,
“Personarum accepcio”, and then an exposition oi the sentence:
“Scriptum est, sterilem non pavit et vidue non benefecit.” Three
problems are then propounded and solved: Whether we may believe
in the Pope; whether any one cau be saved without having confessed
to a priest; and whether any oi those drowned in the Red Sea with
Phamoh’s army was saved. This is the worlr, not oi Wyctit but of
lius, end is known under the title: “Tractatus de tribus dubiis factis

Ι in Holomucz que idiote esserunt pro vero ct tamquam iidem anno ¹4¹ 2.

incip: Quia dubitantibus sanum est consulere. Explicit: abscondita
tenebrarum. .

lt is quite otherwise with the tractate De Peniterrcia sive de
Corffessionq the latter title being more appropriate than the former,
as we bave seen that only the first oi the six chapters reiers to tho
Eucharist. This treatise ison the contrary the development oi Wyclii's

doctrine oi the sacrament oi Penance in general. and of Confession
