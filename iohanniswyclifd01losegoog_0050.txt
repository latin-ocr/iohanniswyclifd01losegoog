Christ. Such is the sense ol' the four Gospcls, Ambrose, lemme,
Augustine and other teachers ol Church laws and rites.

Our adversaries· teaching leads to nothing but idolatry. They
do not worship Christ, however, in a silver idol, like the heathen
ol Ephesus, nor even in the vilest ol his creaturos, but they imagine
