be the real material body ol Our Lord, the new doctrine lrom England
suddenly made its appearance, and threatened to overthrow all the
former views ol transubstantiation, impanation and identification. lt
was received with joy by all those who were friendly ιο Wyclil’s
theology. We have some rather uncertain information as to the date
at which this toolr place; in 1399, aa it would appear. This date is
given by a certain opponent of Has, Protiwa, who was apreacher
at thebethlehem Chapel in ¹409 and curate in Porzicz, near Progne,
