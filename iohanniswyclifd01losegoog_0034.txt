INTRODUCTION. xxvtl

put down heresy, especially aa concerns the Euclrarist. They themselves
follow a salse doctrine; first, in asserting that we see Christ’s body
with our bodily eyes, and second, as concerns impanation and
accidents. ,

The authority of St. Thomas is contrary to the great Doctors
ol the Chureh, who unaminously maintain that the consecrated Host
is bread, and never call it a mere accident. And this agrees with
the decree ol Nicholas ll, long belore lnnocent lll’s time, when the
Church still flourished in all its vigum, and the fictions ol modern
schoolmen were unknown. Those must be both blind and thoughtless
who accuse those holy men ol heresy‚ and with them the whole
primitive Church.¹ Hugo ol St. Victor'seems to spealr of Tran-
substantiatien as Ambrose ol the change in Consecration, i. e. to say
that the brcad becomes and is Christ's Body, in so lar that it represents
it, aiter the sacramental words. And that is a greater miracle than
would have been the destruction ol the hread, because the body ol'
Christ is everywhere really present.

“l know net,” says Wyelil in another place, “how to bring
lnnoeent's decrec and the other mere ancient canon, into agreement
with one another.'’

lt is most erroneous to imagine that the doctrine of the remaining
ol the bread alter consecration is opposed to devotion to the ΗοΙ)1
Sacrament. On the contrary, it only serves to counteract that idolatry
by which many adore as God a mathematieal body falsely supposed
to exist by itsell;² it endeavours to put down a salse ferm of worship,
and to concentrate all our devotion on llim whom we sce therein
by saith, Jesus Christ. The fact that we call this sacrament bread,
would show the people that it is rrot the body of Christ.³ Our
opponente conceal this natural identity ol the Sacrament with bread‚
