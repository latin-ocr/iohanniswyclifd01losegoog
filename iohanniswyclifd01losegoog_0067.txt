Finally, lohannes von Przibram quotes the treatise of a certain
anonymous writer, which begins with the words: Nota duo queruntur.
lt too belonged to Wyclil’s school, and agreed with his principles
even to the extent ol copying his very expressions¹

We may here come to a close. lt is quite obvious that Wyclii's
doctrine oi the Eucharist kindled a great conflagration, and became
the source oi a rich literature, to which, though but in a very super·
ficial sketch, l was obliged to point. Hitherto it has been too much ’
the custom to seek ior other sources ol the theological creeds oi
the Hussites and Taborites, and to set aside him to whom alone
they owed their being - John Wyclii.

4. Data ol the tmatlse ‘Da Eucharistia’.

lt appears from Mr. Matthew's researches, which l have already
noticed, that it was undoubtedly the work ol one oi the four last

, years of Wyclil's liic. But it is by no means easy to fix an exact
date lor its productiori, forthere are no indications in the MS. itsels

to guide us. We may say with more or less precision that the treatise
De Blasplremiu, which also deals with the doctrine ol the Lord’s
Suppes, was written alter it, for it is quoted in this work. lt is
possible to come to a more definite answer, it we observe how
Wyclil deals with the subjectos the Eucharist in his SermoneS, in
which we here and there lind passages that agree almost exactly,
word fot word, with the reproductions oi the sante to be read in
De Euclrarisliu. Now it would be absurd to suppose that Wyclif
copied his own writings; therefore the only hypothesis on which we
can fall back is that they were written at the same time; and that
alone can account ior their great similarity, both in matter and
form. So we may say that our tractate was written at the
