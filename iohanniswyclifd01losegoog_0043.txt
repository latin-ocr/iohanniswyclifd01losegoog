thing happens to Christ’s body, and both are united and identieai. li not,
there is no real change that we can conceive as taking place in con· ·
sacration; we cannot admit any change but that of identification with
Christ’s body. This is the opinion oi Peter Lornbard smongst others.

, We here reply that a great number oi terms that are nt variance
with the language oi Holy Writ, have been invented to increase islse
devotion to the sacrament, as transubstantiation, conversion, identifi-
cation, impanation and other expressions, in using which the isithiul
should bevrare oi falling into heresy, lor the very first heresy smongst
Christ's disciples took place regarding this point.¹ We must therelore
note, not only the Catholie sense oi Holy Writ, but also the judieious
writings oi the Fathers, expounding this subject. Every man has not
the right to say that the meaning of Holy Scriptura is this or that;
words ol Holy Writ rnust be understood in the sense given to thern
by the Holy Ghost. And thus it is allowed to any Christian to deny
that the sanetified bread is identically Christ's Bady, although it be
its effective representation. As rnany nithe disciples, not understanding
the words spoken by Christ oi His body and blood, believed that
Christ’s flesh and blood were tn become our bodily iood, so it is
now erroneously believed that the visible bread in the Sacrament is
Christ’s body, and that there is no difference between the representation
and the thing represented.² The Fathers ol the true Church never
believed that this bread is numerally (numeraliter) identical with Christ's
body, and even now it is not believed by the priests who say Mass.
Otherwise sick persons would touch this bread with ardent saith, as the
woman once touched the hem oiChrist's garment; and they would treat
the body oi the Lord with greater devotion than they do. We therelore
see that neither laith, Scriptura, the holy doctors, nor Church law can be
explained to mean that the consecrated bread is the very body olChrist.³
