so that the pcoplc do not know the difference between it and the
Lord's Body. lf the Patriarchs under the Old Law saw by saith
Christ’s humanity in the sacrificial lamb, in manna, and in the water

gushing from the rock, much more may bread, sanctified by Christ’s
own words, represent His Body. And is the Sacrament any·the worse
· because its substance is food? “lf,” says Wyclif, “my doctrine isa
heresy, then tlte Pope and the whole Chnrch of early times were
heretics, because they taught what was true.'' Whoso therefore
obstinately maintains that the bread and wine do not remain in the
consecrated Host, but are an aggregate of accidents without sub·
stance, such a one is an open heretic, and deserves to be expelled
from the bosom of the Chtirch;¹ for he ,contradicts that faith which
St. Angustiae professed‚ and which to the present day has been
disproved neither by believers nor infidels² The opinion attributed 'to

demonstrated nor defended by any one. Besides, certain doctrines
ascribed to him are surely heretical; as when it is asserted that after
issuing of a writ, trial, and conviction‚ a judge should give sentence
according to public evidence, though he knows the sentence to be
unjust. How then canit follow that if St. Thomas afhtms anythitig,
it ought therefore to be preached to tlte peoplei.

necessary that the communicant be in a state of actual grace and
habitual virtue; he must possess the three theological virtues- faith,
hope and charity - and follow Christ in his way of life. l·le must
