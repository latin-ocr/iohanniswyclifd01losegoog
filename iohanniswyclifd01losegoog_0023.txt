xvl INTRODUCTth'.

ln the second chapter (pp. 29-53), Wyclif proceeds to answer
the question, what the Sacrameat is in reality (realiter). Some, as for
instance Thomas Aquinas, say that it is quantity, others, with scotus,
assert that it is quality3 athird opinion is that of Betengarius of
'l'ours, with which a decree of the Church of Rome is in agreement.
Berengarius was of opinion that the Sacrament which is placed on
the altar during Mass becomes after consecratioa not only a sacra·
ment but also the Lord’s body, aud this was then the doctrine of the
whole Church.¹ lt is therefore evident that the Church upheld, asan
article of faith, that the breed and wine, after the consecration of the
Eucharist, remain what they were before.

The Decretal “Ego berengarius'’ tallies with physical per·
ception, with reason, aad with the reaching of the holy Fathers,
Angustiae, Ambrose, Hilary; it is founded on Scripture, Matthew XXVI,
Mark. xlv, Luke XXll, John Vl, rCorinthians Xl and Acts 11. The
second part of the decree might perhaps seem to be contrary to the
first, and therefore to stultify the entire recantation of Berengarius3
for it says that the broad and wine are, after consecration, nota
mere sacrament, but the body aud blood of the Lord, which is broken
like it, and is perceivable as such.

We may answer to this, that neither the bread nor that which
was its occidental form, is the body of the Lord3 as both ancient
aad modern authors assert: “therefore'’, the Gloss observes, “the
confession of Berengarius should be rightly understood, or the new
error will be worse thau the older one, already condemned by the
Church”. And at the present time the opinion of Berengarius, long
ago anathematized as heretical, would be accepted as orthodox.

We must take care to distinguish by a sharp line of demarcation
between what must be taken literally and what in figure. lt is literally
true that Jesus Christ is a man, aad figuratively, that “this rock was
Christ”. lt is in this sense that holy men, in the earliest times of the
Church, understood the words, “body and blood of our Lord’³.²

Ἐκ istis luculenter patet quod ecclesia tunc sensit sentenciam predictam
beringarii esse catholicam et sentenciam illi contrariam esse hereticam. ²Sic
igitur videtur sanctos ecclesie primitive et suos filios post cos intelligere per panem
ct vinum figurative corpus Christi et sanguinem.
