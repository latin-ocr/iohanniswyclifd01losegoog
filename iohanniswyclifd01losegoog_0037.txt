Many who assert Transubstantiation ground it upon false
principles, taking the text ol Matthew Vl: “Give us this day otir
supernatural bread,'’ as the foundation ol.their belief. Such men
resemble the witnesses against Christ who mistoolt His words about
destroying and rebuilding the Temple.

Wyclil’s opponents very frequently mean by accidents that which

Scriptura and the Fathers call breed and wine, as they say that
Christ’s body rather than the bread is to be seen in the Host, and
that the attention olmera should be directed on the former rather
than on the latter. Others say that the accident is without subject,
but conditionally, “il God has willed it so to be'' - which is just

Our author now reverta to the main subject. As regards the

to the body, when the healing power ol the vital principle falls, so
it is with the sacramcn13 it is but as a stone lor the unbelievcr.² ll
all those who adore this Sacrament as a sign, wrongly3 if all who
seek after relics and go on pilgrimages were to attend to this doctrine,
they would attach their mind to what cannot be perceived by the
senses, i. e. to that which the sign represents3 and on perceiving an
outward sign, they would think only ol how it serves to raise the
mind to God. How far God gives His grace to such devotion to
lileless signs, is not our affair. We have merely to believe that He
