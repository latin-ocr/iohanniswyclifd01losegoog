xxvi INTRODUCTlON.

Transubstantiation to the very end ol their lile, as, ior instance St. Thomas,
we answer, first that we have nothing to prove that they remuined
in that belief until their death3¹ and to this assertion we can oppose
many contrary traditions, just as trustworthy, to the effect thet they
retracted in their last moments. Even it they died in their error, that
would be no reason to condemn them to eteroul perdition. Origen
is said to have defended s most wicked and heretical doctrine- that
no one will be everlastingly damned3 - and he leit writings in favour
of it alter his death. Yet who, unless favoured with &special revelation,
could assert that so saintly a man as Origen was lost lor ever?
Angustiae and Jerome tell out on the question whether St. Peter
sinned in feigoittg to have no communications with the heatben.
Neither of them, so fur ns we knoW, retrected what he had
maintained; yet it would be tolty to think that either was doomed
to perdition on that account. '
St. bernard hed a fierce controversy with his opponents on the ,
question* of the immaculate Conception, acontroversy that is still
kept up by the ‘great sects’ (the Dominicans and Franciscans); and
although this is quite as much a question os saith as the permanence
ol the breed after the words ol consecratiou, it would be foolish to
assert that either of the sects is doomed to Hell because ol it. Without
a revelation, such an affirmation ought never to be made; and this
shows us how vain it is to endeavour to prove by such means that
the nature of the bread ceases to subsist.² As ior St. Thomas, it is
believed by many that his works have been much falsified since his
decease by the ‘pseudo-fratres’, secking in every way to become tbe
inquisitors of heresy‚ by which they increased their gains. They thus
laid cunning snares to entrup simple people whose possessions they
covcted‚ and sowed many tares in the field of F ιιίῑὴ.8 But, God be thanked,
our kingdom is free from such inquisition; and many priests and laymen
in this country are better able than the inquisitors to pursue and

¹Nescitur qualem instinctum habuerunt in exitu. ²Nudum est argu-
mentum ed probandum quod non remanet natura punis in hostia consecrata.
³ Pseudolratres post mortem eius corruperunt eius scripte et hoc ideo quia
procuraverunt esse inquisitores pravitatis heretice propter lucrum Benedictus
dominus regnum nostrum liberatum est ab ista inquisitione heretice pravitatis.
