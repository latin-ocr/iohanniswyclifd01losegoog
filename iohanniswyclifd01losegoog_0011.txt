real wine, and not mete accidents‚ are ia reality Christ's Body and
His Blood. We may peruse all his later noris, lor instance the
Prtrgolorium Secte Christi, the Crrrciata, the Dialogus, the Sermones,
De Apostosia‚ De Blasplremio‚ or the present treatises (De Eucharistiae
and De Confessione),· we shall everywhere find the same vehement
attacks. His sermons especially contain very frequent allusioas to the
subject; some of thern indeed seem to be mere extracts from his
larger work, De Eucharistiae.

We know, however, by Wyclil's own confession, that he was
lor a long time far from being opposed to this doctrine; nay, that
he even taught it himself. ln a work said to date from 1381, he
says: “l irankly admit that l have long been in error as regards this
heresy of accidente without a subject”.¹ And in De Eucharistia: “And
though l once took the utmost pains to explain Transubstantiation
in agreement with the sense of the early Church‚ yet l now see that
the modern Chureh contradicts the Church‘ os former times, and errs
in this doctrine”.² His researches in this theological field are ola
much earlier date.³ ln one of his later sermons, he says: “For many
years l sought to learn of the Friars what the real essence oi the
consecrated Host might be. They at length had the boldness to
maintain that the Host was nothing”.⁴

lt was rather late that he rejected this doctrine. ln De Bene-
dicta Incornotione, written before 1378, he alludes to the miracle oi
transubstantiation in the Host. But his expressions ure here to some
extent ambiguous. While in one place he affirms that God’s power
can make an accident sels-existent, as is seen in the Eucharist,⁵ he
states in another that this miraculous transubstantiation does not
prove that quality or inherent quantity cau exist by themselves.⁶ ln
