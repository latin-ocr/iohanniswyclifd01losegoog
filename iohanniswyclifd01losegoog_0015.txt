''Now, as Dr. Shirley remarks,¹ iu aestate must mean after
Easter, which in 1381 1111 01 14 April. ‘Does this’, he aslis, ‘allow
time 101111 that passed in the interimi’ lle is content to 11111 the
doubt without attempting 10 resolve it, but 11 11 1111 10 strongly by
Mr. Poole, the latest writer on the subject, that he attempts to gaiu
time by making the end 01 the proceedings later. ‘l suspect', he
says, ‘that the actual condemnation did not talre place until the
bginning of 1382.’² This suggestion is based on the uncertainty
01 the dates of the chancellors, an uncertainty which, lthinlr, can
be cleared up. Among the petitions in the Rolls 011111 101 the im·
prisonment 01 persons contumacious under excommunicatori, are
many from the chancellor 01 011ο111, and among them l have noted
petitions from Berton 11 February 1380-81 and 6 April 1381; from
Rygge 20 November 1181, 1 March 1381-81, to September 1381.
The 011111 01 chancellor was then tenuble 101 two years. The electione
were held on the Thursduy before Whitsunday‚³ which Thursday in
1381 1111 01 May 30. On that day there can be no reasonable doubt
that Berton left office.

“lt is, then, clearly impossible 10 make the proceedings last on
into 1381, and we ere again shut up into the narrow space between
Easter and 10 May. But even this has 10 be got by putting a strain
upon lenguage. The natural interpretation ofin aestate would seem
to be in the summer term which began on the Wednesday after
Trinity Sunday,⁴ and in this case the commencement 01 the 111111
must be referred back to 1380. 11 11 10 be noticed that in the
manuscript (Bodley‚ 703) which alone gives the date 01 Wyclif's
confession, the date ot' the year has been altered by erasure from
M⁰CCC⁰LXXX⁰I⁰ by eresing the 1ο 10 11 10 leave 1380.ὗ This would
throw baclr the rise 01 the controversy to ¹379· l should not object
to the date in itself, but it 11 impossible to attach serious weight
to such an alteration by an unknown hand.

“l may support this contention for an earlier date by an in-
ference from the text 01 the contemporary St. Albans chronicler. lle
