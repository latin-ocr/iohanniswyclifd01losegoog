Maundy Thursday in the church ol St. Gallus, had asserted that
alter consecration the bread still remaiued as before.¹

Paul ol St. Castulus, preacher, spoke to tlte same effect,
quoting the very figure employed by llus. He had said: “Alter
consecration the accidents remain with the subject in the sacrament
ol the altar; as a man in a tunic, as the soul in the body, so God
is in the bread.” And in one ol his sermons: “lt is said in the
Bible, ‘l am the bread'3 or‚‚‘Come, eat bread and not my body', ake.

Andrew von Brod’s statement amounts to the same. His curate
(clericus) had told him of Hus' preaching that the bread remained
alter consecration. Another time llus hatl said: “These country
priests treat me badly, because l have preached that the breed
remeius in the consecrated l-lost. And l should much like to know
what is broken, if not bread.'’² Niclrolas ol l'odwinie told a similar
tale. The parish priest, Nicholaus of Wsetat heard from the
‘Magister' Hus that the bread temalned alter consecration³

Wenceslaus of Wodicrad, notary, had several times been
present at the sermons of Hus, who spoke alter this fashion: “Truly',
what do you see? lltave often told you” - a favourite expression ol
Wyclil - “that we see Christ by faith in the bread that is elevated
by the priest. Let him but eat enough ol tlte bread, and he will
be lull; drink enough of the wine, and his thirst will be quenclred.⁴

Hus denied the truth of some ol these statements, arrd endea-
voured to explain others; but his allegations are osten confused and
antbiguous. We should preler to admit the testimony ol his adver-
saries, particularly as they were ull on their oath. lt is, however,
admissible that misunderstandings may erise in dealing before the
people with matters ol such dilliculty.

ll there could be any doubt that Hus lavoured Wyclil’s doctrine

of tlte Eucharist uo less than his friends Stephanos Palecz and
Stanislaus ol Znaim, we may refer to his treatise lle Corpore Cht·t'str'.·'’
