for fear of the Archbishop. .

One passage of the writings of Hus shows how decidedly
Stanislaus of Znaim leaned towards Wyciif's ideas on the Eucharist.
He tells us to read Stanislaus' commentary on the foirrth book of
sentences, where he deais with the Eucharistic question and, asked
foe his opinion about ‘Magister lohannes Wicleff,’ expresses it thus:
“A certain Doctor, Master John Wyclif, who is also a profound
theologian and philosopher in other matters, follows the doctrine that
lhave above set forth and many times promises in his writings, as
a faithful son of the Choreb, that he will believe the contrary if'
shown anything better to believe; but that otherwise he will rather
suffer death than give it up. And yet many believe him to.bea
heretic, not considering that we gather most beautiful roses amongst
thorns.’'² lt is seen by these words that Stanislaus alludes to no
other tractate of Wyclif but the De Eucharistiae, which contains that
very protestation, almost in those very words. When Stanislaus left
the path he had formerly trod, and was attached by his friends of
oid times, he admitted that he had written a treatise on the ‘Re-
manence of the bread’, but that he had impartially given the argu-
ments on both sides, after the scholastic manner of proceeding.³ That
his treatise contained nothing heretical, is a fact acknowledged even
by a cardinal of the Charch and by Alexander V!

Many such worlrs, with the same title, were written in Bohemia
ar about this time; they are unfortunately lost for the greater part.
There is still to be found among the Vienna MSS (3929) a treatise

quod Stanisiaus in tractatu ilio scripsit quedam criiorata motiva pro iiia parte, scilicet
quod remaneat panis materialis in sua substancia in sacramento altaris, postea scripsit
motiva pro alia parte contradiccionis, probando illam esse catholicam. ⁸ 'l'ractarus
