tyrants though they be, have not dared to condemn the words of
that Saint as heretical.¹ This is also Augustine’s teaching. “Let not
that which thou seest appear contemptible uoto thee. What thou seest
passas away; but that which it signifies does not pass, but remains.
ls Christ’s body consumed? ln no wise.'' The Saints make the sante .
distinction between this sign and Christ's body, as between the creature
and God; they never had the least conception of a quality without
asubject.² lf it were possible lor qualities to exist in such a manner,
we might pray to them as to the Saints3 but we properly worship
the Saints themselves and not their qualities of faith, hope, or charity.
Whiteness (albedo) is not by itself a sacrament, but inherent thereto‚
and its subject is by far more perfect than the quality that it sustains.
Why is the sacrament white? because it is natural bread, the subject
both of quantity and of quality.³

Wyclil now comes to examine tlte question whether we see
God with our bodily eyes. He says that his opponents affirm that
we do, and quote many passages from the Old Testament. lt is
however absolutely necessary to distinguish sharply between bodily,
imaginary, and intellectual vision, or we shall be hopelessly confused.
No one can see Christ with the bodily eye. We see the llost with
the eye, and God by faith. intellectual, as well as imaginary vision, is
threefold; intuitive (as the saints see God), abstractive (as philosoplrers
know God) and enigmatical (as the sight of God by saith). The first
is the ttuest and the chief sense. None has seen the Divinity with
bodily eyes3 therefore God cannot be thus seen in the Host.⁴

ln favour of the identification theory, it is said that, according
to Scripture, the Fathers, and the decrees ol the Clturch, the bread
which we perceive has become Christ’s body; consequently the same
