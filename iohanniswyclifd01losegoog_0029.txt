We must, with the Church, hold to the canon Ego Berengarius,
in which it is affirmed that the bread and wine are not merely breed
and wine alter the sacramental words are uttered, but that they also
are tho body and blood ol Christ. Our rnodern Doctors and Bishops,
lar lrom venturing to contradict this decision ola Council, should
examine with care what the real entity ol tbe Host is. “l heve
frequently”, says Wyclif, α0011011 those who loved to dispute upon
the subject, and attach others as heretica, what the sacrament ol
the Altar is in ite 0010000. nnd as they could not anewer this question,
it is plain that they can know nothing ol the other points that are
only consequentes drawn therelrom.¹ Neither ol the two popes with
nll his 1011011010, 001 all the Rishops and Doctors in England can
tellus what the Host is: how then can they decide about heresies
concerning it?“

Many other points in dispute are 0100 importance. lt is 101 ”
instance quite irrelevant in what veasel the priest celebrates. To follow
the customs ol the country and to have a right and proper knowledge
ol Christ, is lar better than all the ceremonies ol celebration 01 Mass.
What is essential ia, that Christ should dwell in the hearts 01 Η10
laithlul; and a layman who remembers that Christ⁸s body is in Heaven,
does more than the priest that consecratos, lorChrist's body is more
ellectively present to him, though indeed in another sense.

But the lact is that the people believe a doctrine most wickedly
blasphemous: that the sacramental sign 01 Christ’s Body is l·lis
body in reality.² Many 01 the clergy and prelates live in this heresy.
Others grant that it is blasphemetis, but say that 11 1110 110111 were
made lrnown to the people, their devotion would die away. Their
real motive lor opposing the truth is worldly glory and lucre, Pious

priests ought to celebrate very often; lor he is not worthy to celebrate,

lv ’ἵ ¹ Solebam querere ab 010 qui volunt in ista matoria determinare et impetere
alios super heretica pravitate quid est sacramentum altaris. Quod curn ignorant,

' patet quod necesse 001 000 sequencia ignorare. l'ix enirn alter papa curn 011100010-

plicibus, omnes episcopi Anglie curn suis doctoribus sciunt dicere quid 001 hostia
consecrata. Quomodo ergo diffinirent ipsi in heresi? ² Sed vulgus credit nimis
infideliter et blaspheme quod hoc signum sacramentale· corporis Christi sit realiter
ipse Christus. Et in iata heresi involvuntur clerici et prelati.
